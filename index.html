			<h2> Introduction</h2>
				<p>
					Hello! My name is Danielle Roth, I'm a design student out of Cheney, Washington. I am passionate about design, people, and nature. I am currently studying to receive my Bachelor of Fine Arts Degree in Visual Communications Design at Eastern Washington University. I enjoy volunteering, working with my local church, and spending as much time as I can with my husband of two years, David. 
				</p>
			<h3> Volunteer Experience </h3>
				<p>
					I have acted as a volunteer youth counselor for the previous 2 years through the AWANA program. This has given me wonderful opportunities to develop as a leader and mentor. I have also functioned as a volunteer coordinator of the worship support team and provider of technical support for regular Sunday services at my church, Cheney Community Church, for the past two years. This time has grown me in developing communication, time management, and organizational skills, as well as helping me to become a good team player.</p>
